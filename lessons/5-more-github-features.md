- Under your repository name, click Insights.
- In the left sidebar, click "Community" 
    - Here you will find other files recommendation that you can add in your repo
    - These files are useful when working with collaborators or members in your community
    - Specifically look at 'license', 'contributing', 'description'
    - Whenever possible, add a few lines as 'code of conduct' to make your project welcoming and inclusive for others
- Other interesting things to look at are "Contributors" (those who contribute to your project), "Traffic" (who and when visits your project page), "Commits" (a timeline and number of commits made on your project),
