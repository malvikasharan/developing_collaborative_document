Reference : [Welcome to Mozilla Science Lab's Study Group Orientation](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/3.1-collab-vers-github.html)

#### Aim of this section

- Defining Collaborative Documents
- Understanding challenges in collaborations

#### Questions

- What are collaborative documents for you?
    - Working with many people on a single project: planning and running multi-institution research initiative to collect and analyze data or the process of co-creating, sharing, and updating learning materials for your project.

- What are the main challenges?
    - When we code, write text or create any kind of content using computers, we end up with a collection of files in a folder or directory, also known as a repository, or “repo.”
    - Your contributors for your repo may be spread around the world or working in the same room; they may be working simultaneously or asynchronously and create different versions of a document.
