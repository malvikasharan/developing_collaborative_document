*Write your README* - [Mozilla Science Lab](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/1.2-write-a-readme.html)

**IN your README, Be sure  to:**

- **Say hello!** Welcome people to the Group. It’s great to introduce yourself here, so people know they’re dealing with a person or group of real people. Let potential members know you’re excited that they’re here to learn more.

- **Write a SHORT group description.** In your own words. Try to phrase this so it’s understandable and appealing to a wide variety of people, not just those in your field. Maybe add sentence or two about your focus for the semester or year, etc. 

**Include some key details.** 

- Note any meeting times and places, contact people, etc.

- Ask for what you need! If your group wants to learn or work on a certain topic, but doesn't have the expertise, mention that here-- that way, perspective members can see if their skills are needed!

- Test your README for jargon When you’re working in any field, whether it’s software engineering or astrophysics, you’ll learn and use jargon -- terms that have a special meaning to your field but likely won’t make sense to anyone who isn’t part of that field. Too much jargon can confuse newcomers, so use simple langauge and define all potentailly confusing terms here.

- Share your project with others.

If you're having trouble getting started, here's some basic text-- feel free to copy-paste and edit content from the [README file from this repo](./../README.md).
