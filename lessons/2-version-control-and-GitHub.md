#### Aim of this section

- Introduction to Version Control
- Introduction to GitHub

#### Questions:

1. What is version control?

“version control,” the task of managing the many contributions your group makes to shared working documents.

No matter how your group is organized, the work of many contributors needs to be wrangled into a single project. Version control manages this process: it stores a history of changes and who made them, allowing you to revert or go back to earlier versions of those documents, and understand how contributions by different contributors have changed the project over time. You may have used word processing software that has a “changes,” “history” or “revisions” feature, which also allows you to see and revisit any changes to the document: this, too, is a form of version control. 

If you’ve never used any specialized version control software before, it may help to look at some diagrams and define some new terms before you get started [here](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/3.1-collab-vers-github.html).

2. What is GitHub?

**GitHub is online web interface**, it’s designed to share your work, and allows other people to “fork” your project-- meaning they can create an independent copy of your work to test, modify, remix and reuse it.

There are lots to know about GitHub-- it has terrific project management features, a social platform, and communication tools that are useful for any project where a group of people is working together on the same set of documents.
