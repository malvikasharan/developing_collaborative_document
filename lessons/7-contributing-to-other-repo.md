### Fork a repo that your neighbours own

If you don’t own repo and aren’t an official collaborator:
- you will fork a repo
- work on your forked copy of the repo 
- make a pull request for the changes you’ve made
- author/owner will decide to merge them in.

*A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.*
